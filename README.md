# Frontend Mentor - Notification Page

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (fully responsive on all screens).

<br/>

## The Aim 

- To build out this notification page and get it as close to the design as possible.
- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications.
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
